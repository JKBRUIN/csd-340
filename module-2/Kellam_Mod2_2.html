        <h1>Assignment 2.3 <!--Why 2.3 and not 2.2?--> - Building a Web Page Exercise, Part 2</h1>
        <h2>First Chapter for 2.3(2.2?)</h2>
        <p class="intro">I'm from a small town in central Indiana. My highschool class was 92 students and was the biggest class in over a decade. We were surrounded by woods and fields.</p>
        <p>I played football starting in the 5th grade through the beginning of college.  I was a lineman.  It was fun but tough.  I ended up getting cut after a new coach was hired.</p>
        <p>I loved science growing up, so I studied biology.  I couldn't earn good money (pay bills) without 10 years of experience or going to graduate school.  I moved to NWI to work in a tool crib at an automotive factory for double the pay.</p>
        <p>Because I could pay bills now, I got my own apartment and paid off my car.  After five years, I was able to land a job in production at a soda factory.  After four more years, I was able to transfer in to quality control (one year short of 10 years experience).  So now I use some science again at work, but I deal with mostly data and audit compliance.  <span class="sentence">I enrolled in this program at Bellevue to get a more applicable degree that I'll use in many more fields.  This is my second attempt in the class because I had to withdraw for a family medical emergency.  I wish I didn't have to leave but I still need to do this to move into the fields I would like to retire from.</span></p>
